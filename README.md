# Hi there, I'm Sebastian Tampu! 👋

### 🚀 About Me
I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** and **Data Scientist** with a fixation for solving complex problems and uncovering insights through data. My journey started with a background in **physics**, evolved into **data science**, with a particular focus on **AI and machine learning**.  

I'm always exploring how cutting-edge technology can merge with creativity and strategy—whether it's building **emotion detection models**, designing **AI-driven D&D content**, or analyzing **sports and racing data**.

### 🛠️ What I Do
- **AI/ML Development**: Specializing in deep learning, clustering, and predictive modeling. Quickly improving my generative models.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating dashboards and visual stories using Tableau, Power BI, and Python.
- **Perdonalized Coding Projects**: Combining my interests in **physics**, **games**, and **strategy** with practical AI applications.

### 💡 Current Projects
- Developing a **Go strategy assistant** powered by machine learning.
- Exploring **F1 performance analysis** with AI.
- Building **generative AI models** for D&D and fantasy storytelling.

### 🌍 Interests
When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- Learning whatever I can, from languages to music production and trying to improve at the game of **Go**.
- Immersed in **D&D world-building** and fantasy stories.
- Watching **F1** or **Borussia Dortmund**.
