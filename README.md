- 👋 Hi, I’m @SebT21
- 👀 I’m interested in perhaps too many things. It always gives me a tough time choosing what to focus on. I love analyzing everything around me and predicting what will happen next.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data science, machine learning, and statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects dealing with any topic. I get interested in pretty much everything I work on, so any collaboration, no matter how different to my work, is welcome.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email is sebastian.tampu@gmail.com

I'm starting out, so still figuring out formatting options and what not. Everything will probably be getting constantly updated as I learn more options, but it will still be organized logically regardless. All repositories have self-explanatory titles and the README files inside; each one will describe all the other projects inside.
